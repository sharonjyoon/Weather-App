# Weather-Dashboard

The weather dashboard allows the user to search for whatever city they desire by name. 
It will return the current day forecast that includes information such as the temperature in degrees fahrenheit, humidity, wind speed, and the uv index. The UV index is color coded to show whether the UV index is considered low, medium, or high. This is indicated by the colors green for low, yellow for medium, and red for high.

It will also display a five day forecast for the searched city. This will include items such as the current date and time as well as the temperature in degrees Farhenheit, and the humidity. 

In addition, all cities that were recently searched will be displayed below the search bar. They will appear when the search button is pressed. The user can click on these cities themselves and the information regarding the weather for that city will appear below. These cities will persist on the page even when page is refreshed. 

The weather dashboard was built with Bulma.io and documentation can be found here: https://bulma.io/
